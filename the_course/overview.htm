<p class="toc-heading">Overview: <strong>MarkLogic Data Integration</strong></p>
<p><a href="#"></a>Length: <strong>2 days</strong></p>
<p>In this 2-day course, you integrate data from disparate systems to create a <strong>data hub</strong> in MarkLogic. First, you <strong>load data</strong> from a variety of sources that is in a variety of structures. Then you <strong>harmonize</strong> the data, while learning a number of techniques for doing so. Next you load and use <strong>triples</strong>, including  for harmonization. Then you create <strong>templates</strong>, for use with SQL and Optic API queries. Optionally, you then provide <strong>SQL</strong>-based applications  with access to your data hub. Next, while learning how to write <strong>Optic API</strong> queries, you stand up a 360° customer view application that uses your data hub. Finally, you learn how to use <strong>Entity Services</strong> to model entities and generate useful artifacts. </p>
<p>The  prerequisite for this course is the <strong>MarkLogic Fundamentals </strong>course. In addition,  recommended prerequisites include any of the <strong>MarkLogic Developer I</strong> courses (XQuery, Node.js, or Java), and the <strong>MarkLogic Semantics</strong> course. </p>

For live training online, you will want to have two computers (or one computer with two monitors) so that you can see what the instructor is doing on one monitor, while you are working on the second monitor.</p>
<p>For the self-paced version of this course, you will want to do the setup steps in the self-paced course videos to ensure that your computer will be able to run the course virtual machine (downloadable from MarkLogic University) locally.</p>
<p>This course was written on the CentOS platform, using a virtual machine from MarkLogic University (for running on a Windows, Macintosh, Linux, or Solaris host computer).</p>
<p>This course could also potentially  be done without the course virtual machine, directly on a Linux computer (for setup, see <a href="units/xb02_x_see_the_steps_that_were_done.htm" target="_blank">See the Steps That Were Done</a>), or on a Macintosh or Windows computer (with adjustments as needed, such as file paths, and MarkLogic installation steps). For a list of operating systems supported by MarkLogic, please see the <a href="http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/installation" target="_blank">MarkLogic Installation Guide</a>.<br>
